# 1. Identification of Stakeholders and End Users  

## Stakeholders  

### Non-Technical Users  
These are individuals who need to interact with databases but do not possess advanced SQL knowledge. Examples include marketers, students, and business/data analysts. Their needs are centered on having a user-friendly platform that minimizes technical barriers.

### Technical Team  
This group includes backend and frontend developers, UI/UX designers, and QA engineers who are responsible for building, maintaining, and improving the platform. For them, DBuddy is not just a tool but also a framework they can extend, debug, and scale. Their involvement is critical, as they ensure the platform remains robust, scalable, and aligned with evolving technological standards.  

### Small Teams and Start-ups  
These are smaller organizations or development teams that need to move fast and optimize their limited resources. For them, DBuddy helps save time by automating repetitive tasks like schema visualization, data seeding, and generating boilerplate code. This enables them to focus more on innovation and product development rather than backend setup. 

### Database Administrators (DBAs)  
Database Administrators are professionals responsible for the installation, configuration, security, and performance tuning of PostgreSQL databases. Their interest in DBuddy lies in the assurance that the tool will not only simplify database interactions for others but also integrate seamlessly with their workflows. DBAs are important because they provide expert validation of the platformâ€™s reliability and practical applicability in real-world environments.  

### Legal and Regulatory Bodies  
This stakeholder group ensures that DBuddy complies with a wide range of data privacy, governance, and security regulations. They are not active users of the platform but have indirect influence over how it is designed and maintained. Their main interest is that sensitive data is handled responsibly, securely, and in full accordance with regional and global data protection laws.
