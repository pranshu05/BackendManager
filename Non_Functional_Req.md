# Non-Functional Requirements

These define quality standards and constraints:

## Usability

-   **UI/UX**: The system shall have a simple, clean, and intuitive user
    interface, inspired by platforms like Notion.
-   **Responsiveness**: The application's layout must be responsive,
    adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and
    mobile phones).
-   **Transparency**: To build user trust and facilitate learning, the
    system shall show the generated SQL queries.
-   **Error Handling**: All error messages must be displayed in clear,
    simple language, avoiding technical terms.

## Performance

-   **Concurrency**: Handle multiple users/projects concurrently.

## Reliability & Availability

-   **Connection Stability**: The system must ensure stable and
    persistent connections to the user's database.

## Security

-   **Authentication & Encryption**: Use secure authentication and
    encrypted connections.

## Scalability

-   **Growth Support**: The system must support growing datasets, an
    increasing number of projects, and increasing user load.
-   **Extensibility**: Modular backend to allow adding future features
    easily.

## Maintainability

-   **Architecture**: The code shall follow a modular architecture with
    a clear separation between the frontend and backend.
-   **Documentation**: The code must be well-documented for easy
    maintenance, updates, and expansion.
-   **Development Process**: Must support agile incremental
    improvements.
